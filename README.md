# Word Error Rate Estimation Without ASR Output: e-WER2

  This is the second version of e-WER (e-WER2).

# New Features!

- An end-to-end multistream architecture to predictthe WER per sentence using language-independent phonotactic features.
- Our novel system is able to learn acoustic-lexical embeddings 
- We estimate the error rate directly without having access to the ASR results nor the ASR system â€“ *no-box* WER estimation

# Model definition
An end-to-end multistream based regression model to predict the WER per sentence.

We combine the four streams: lexical, phonotactic, acoustics and numerical features into a single end-to-end network to estimate word error rate directly. We jointly train the multistream network and their final hidden layers are concatenated to obtain a joint feature space in which another fully connected layer to estimate the WER directly.

# Results
Test set cumulative WER over all sentences X-axis is duration in hours and Y-axis is WER in %.
